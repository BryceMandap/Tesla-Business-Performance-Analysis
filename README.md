# Tesla Business Performance Analysis

As Tesla is becoming an increasingly popular vehicle manufacturer, I wanted to discover how well they are performing by quantifying/analyzing real data. To help quantify their business performance, I analyzed a variety of features. I specifiically was interested in measurements of vehicle sales rates, marketshares, and stock evaluations.


## Python Utilities
- Google Collab 
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn 
- Plotly 
- Matplotlib

## Dataset
US Department of Energy: *US. plug-in electric vehicle sales by model* 
- Recorded the amount of sales for each fully electric and/or hybrid vehicle by car model from 2011-2019

Yahoo Finance: *(TSLA)* *Stock Historical Prices & Data*
- Stock data that included features as date, closing price, open price, adjusting price, volumem etc.

## Summary of Findings
Truly identifying the success of a company can depend on several if not thousands of
factors. For simplicity, I condensed the idea of success in smaller metrics and KPI’s.
- **Sales Rate**
    -  The **Model S** had a growth rate of about **7 percent**. 
     - The **Model X** had a **93 percent** increase.
    - The **Model 3** had a **78 percent increase**. 
    - I found that the average growth sales rate for all Tesla car models was about 60 percent. This data indicates that Tesla has had a positive growth rate in sales from years 2011 to 2019.
- **Marketshare**
    - Tesla’s vehicles have the **largest market share** compared to their competitors. 
    - I also found that two, out of the three, models sold by Tesla (Model S and 3) are the **most selling vehicles**. 
    - **Model X** was placed at the **6th most selling EV model** 
     - Tesla Inc as a whole, had around **38 percent** control over the market
 - **Stock Evaluation**
    - Tesla’s stock has a **positive linear relationship** as the years continue.
     - The growth rate of Tesla’s stock was around **62%**
